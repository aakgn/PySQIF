Quantum Mechanical Current Density
==================
Let's we define wave function of a particle as below:

.. math:: \Psi = Aexp(j\varphi(t))

We can write Schrodinger equation of the particle as below:

.. math:: i\hbar\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\triangledown^2\Psi + \hat{V}\Psi
